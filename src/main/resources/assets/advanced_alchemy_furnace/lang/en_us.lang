advanced_alchemy_furnace.research.advanced_alchemy.text=The standard alchemical furnace is fairly slow and requires fuel to operate. While neither of those are particularly difficult obstacles to you, the fact that it is unable to process large sources of essentia is something that can not be ignored. Unfortunately the instability of the essentia slurry it creates makes it dangerous to gather too much of it in one location.

While neither of those are particularly difficult obstacles to you, the fact that it is unable to process large sources of essentia is something that can not be ignored. Unfortunately the instability of the essentia slurry it creates makes it dangerous to gather too much of it in one location.<BR>With the discovery of Primordial Pearls you have found a solution to that problem - The Advanced Alchemical Furnace.<BR>Using alchemical constructs that have been strengthened with void metal and exposed to a primordial pearl's strange energies much more slurry can be processed at once and at much greater speeds. The pearl is not consumed during the crafting process.<BR>Instead of fuel, heat is generated by ignis vis and instead of relying on heat alone perditio vis breaks down objects almost instantly. Lastly aqua vis keeps everything running smoothly and prevents the slurry from settling and causing problems.<BR>The machine requires a considerable amount of heat to function and requires a constant supply of ignis vis even when not operating. Perditio and aqua vis is only used when the machine is smelting.
